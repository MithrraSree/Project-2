# Project-2
Audible Insights is an intelligent book recommendation system that uses NLP, clustering, and machine learning to suggest personalized reads. It features a Streamlit web app and is deployable on AWS for broad accessibility.

Audible Insights: Intelligent Book Recommendations
Audible Insights is an intelligent book recommendation system designed to provide personalized suggestions using Natural Language Processing (NLP), clustering, and machine learning techniques. The system includes a Streamlit-powered web interface and is fully deployable on AWS.

Project Overview
This project aims to help readers discover books tailored to their tastes, empower libraries and bookstores with smarter inventory suggestions, and assist authors/publishers with reader insights. The recommendation engine leverages two datasets of book details, ratings, and user interactions, which are preprocessed and analyzed before model building.

Business Use Cases
Personalized Reading Experience: Recommend books based on individual preferences, reading history, and favorite genres or authors.

Enhanced Library Systems: Aid libraries/bookstores in suggesting popular or related titles to boost borrowing/sales.

Publisher/Author Insights: Offer data-driven trends about popular genres and reader demand.

Reader Engagement: Boost engagement by suggesting top-rated or trending books.

Approach
1.  Data Preparation
Merge datasets based on book titles, authors, etc.

Handle missing values and duplicates.

2. Data Cleaning
Standardize rating scales and genres.

Remove incomplete and irrelevant entries.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Discover top genres, rating distributions, and author trends.

Visualize trends in reader engagement and book popularity.

4. NLP & Clustering
Extract features using NLP from book titles/descriptions.

Cluster similar books using algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.

5. Recommendation Models
Content-Based Filtering: Based on book metadata.

Clustering-Based: Based on feature similarity.

Hybrid Systems: Combine multiple strategies.

Evaluate using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Application Development
Build a responsive user interface with Streamlit:

Search by book title, author, or genre

Get personalized recommendations

View EDA visualizations

7. Deployment
Deploy the Streamlit app to AWS EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk

Store processed data or models in AWS S3 for scalability
